How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  User needs are essential to the success of the application. While the investors, client, and product owner will set the 
general needs for the project, they will ultimately have to adjust with the user's needs. User stories is critical with this process. 
They allow you to have direct solutions to problems or needs and also help you find issues or concepts you may have not thought of. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  There are so many approaches from the agile process that I hope to incorporate into my future development. I think the agile framework allows the team more more cohesive and flexible and meet the needs of investors and end user. Prioritizing certain parts of the project and getting them into release and testing quick will be important in my future development. Being able to create and understand that backlog will not only help me get better with a future job, but for any personal projects as well. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Being a good team member in software development means knowing your role for the specific task assigned to you, but also being able to jump in with other tasks if needed. Too often, workers will focus on their area of expertise or the one portion of the project they are working on. With the right communication, you can not only help other team members from other tasks, but give them the opportunity to help you. This helps build a culture of communication and I think continuing that culture falls on each teammember.
